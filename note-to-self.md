# notes to self

create branch for updates to index / faq / tutorial / css 
- as these can be previewed while editing
- they can be pulled and the branches deleted at end of day

updates to search.php and its related pages (js css) should be added to main
- these can only be viewed on namecheap
- less difficult to add to namecheap
- make sure to check files are updatedc before leaving
